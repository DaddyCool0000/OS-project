🛠️ Process Visualization Tool
The Process Visualization Tool is a web-based application designed to help users understand and visualize how operating system process scheduling works. It provides an interactive and intuitive interface for simulating CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), SJF (Shortest Job First), Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.

🚀 Features
🔄 Simulation of popular CPU scheduling algorithms

📊 Dynamic Gantt chart generation for process execution

✍️ Input custom process data (Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority, etc.)

⏱️ Real-time calculation of Turnaround Time and Waiting Time

📱 Responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

📷 Demo
(You can include a GIF or screenshot of the app here once it's available.)

📂 Technologies Used
HTML5 – For structure

CSS3 – For styling and layout

JavaScript – For dynamic interaction and logic

(Optional) Charting libraries like Chart.js or custom SVG for Gantt chart

🧑‍💻 How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/process-visualization-tool.git
Open index.html in your browser.

Input the number of processes and their respective details.

Select a scheduling algorithm and click "Visualize".

Analyze the generated Gantt chart and time statistics.

📈 Scheduling Algorithms Supported
FCFS (First Come First Serve)

SJF (Shortest Job First) – Preemptive & Non-Preemptive

Round Robin (with user-defined time quantum)

Priority Scheduling

🎯 Project Goals
To help students and professionals visualize process scheduling concepts.
